	<h1>What is <abbr title="Object Oriented Programming">OOP</abbr></h1>
	<dl><dt>OOP stands for <strong>Object-Oriented Programming</strong>.</dt>
	<dd>Procedural programming is about writing procedures or methods that perform operations on the data,<br /> while object-oriented programming is about creating objects that contain both data and methods.</dd></dl>
	<p>Object-oriented programming has several advantages over procedural programming:</p>
	<ul>
	<li>OOP is faster and easier to execute</li>
	<li>OOP provides a clear structure for the programs</li>
	<li>OOP helps to keep the Java code DRY "Don't Repeat Yourself",and makes the code easier to maintain, modify and debug</li>
	<li>OOP makes it possible to create full reusable applications with less code and shorter development time</li>
	</ul>
	<details>
	<summary>Tips:</summary>
	<p>The "Don't Repeat Yourself" (DRY) principle is about reducing the repetition of code. You should extract out the codes that are common for the application, and place them at a single place and reuse them instead of repeating it.</p>

	<blockquote>Many of the most widely used programming languages (such as C++, Java, Python, etc.) are <em>multi-paradigm</em> and they support object-oriented programming to a greater or lesser degree, typically in combination with <em>imperative, procedural programming</em>.Significant object-oriented languages include,
	<ol>
		<li>Java</li> 
		<li>C++</li>
		<li>C#</li>
		<li>Python</li> 
		<li>PHP</li>
		<li>JavaScript</li>
		<li>Ruby</li>

	<h2>Java - What are Classes and Objects?</h2>
	<p><b><i>Classes</b></i> and <b><i>objects</b></i> are the two main aspects of object-oriented programming<br /><br />
	A class is a template for objects, and an object is an instance of a class.<br /><br />
	When the individual objects are created, they inherit all the variables and methods from the class.
	</p>
	
	<h2>Java Classes/Objects</h2>
	<p>Java is an object-oriented programming language.<br /><br />

Everything in Java is associated with classes and objects, along with its attributes and methods. <br /><br />For example: in real life, a car is an object. The car has <strong>attributes</strong>, such as weight and color, and <strong>methods</strong>, such as drive and brake.

A Class is like an object constructor, or a <q>blueprint</q> for creating objects.
	</p>
		<h2>Create a Class</h2>
		<p>To create a class, use the keyword <code>class:</code></p>
		<h3>Myclass.java</h3>
		<p>Create a class named <code><q>MyClass</q></code> with a variable x:</p>
		<p> <code>public class MyClass {<br />int x = 5;}</code></p>
		
	<h2>Create an Object</h2>
	<p>In Java, an object is created from a class. We have already created the class named MyClass, so now we can use this to create objects.</p>
	<p>To create an object of <code>MyClass</code>, specify the class name, followed by the object name, and use the keyword <code>new</code></p>
	
	<p>Create an object called <code>myObj</code> and print the value of x:</p>
	<p><code>public class MyClass {<br />int x = 5;<br /><br/>public static void main(String[] args){<br />MyClass myObj = new MyClass();<br />System.out.println(myObj.x);<br />
  }<br />
}</code></p>
